# 🔒 Security

## Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures, best practices, and considerations for the RWA NFT Smart Contract system.

## Security Features

### 1. Access Control

The contracts implement role-based access control using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`:

**RWANFT Roles:**
- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Full contract control
- `MINTER_ROLE`: Can mint new NFTs
- `VERIFIER_ROLE`: Can verify assets and update metadata
- `PAUSER_ROLE`: Can pause/unpause contract

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Use different addresses for different roles
- ✅ Implement multi-sig wallets for admin functions
- ✅ Regularly audit role assignments
- ✅ Use time-locks for sensitive operations

### 2. Reentrancy Protection

Both contracts use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` to prevent reentrancy attacks:

```solidity
function buyNFT(uint256 listingId) 
    public 
    payable 
    whenNotPaused 
    nonReentrant  // ✅ Protected
{
    // ... safe code
}
```

### 3. Pausable Functionality

Emergency stop mechanism to halt operations if needed:

```solidity
function pause() public onlyRole(PAUSER_ROLE) {
    _pause();
}
```

**When to pause:**
- 🚨 Security vulnerability discovered
- 🚨 Unusual or malicious activity detected
- 🚨 During security upgrades
- 🚨 Major bug found

### 4. Input Validation

All functions validate inputs:

```solidity
require(to != address(0), "Cannot mint to zero address");
require(price > 0, "Price must be greater than zero");
require(valuationUSD > 0, "Valuation must be greater than zero");
```

### 5. Safe Token Transfers

Uses OpenZeppelin's safe transfer methods:

```solidity
_safeMint(to, tokenId);  // ✅ Checks if receiver can handle ERC721
nft.safeTransferFrom(seller, buyer, tokenId);  // ✅ Safe transfer
```

## Security Audits

### Recommended Audits

Before mainnet deployment, we recommend:

1. **Smart Contract Audit**
   - CertiK
   - ConsenSys Diligence
   - Trail of Bits
   - OpenZeppelin

2. **Automated Tools**
   - Slither
   - Mythril
   - Securify

### Running Security Analysis

```bash
# Install Slither
pip3 install slither-analyzer

# Run analysis
slither .

# Install Mythril
pip3 install mythril

# Analyze contracts
myth analyze contracts/RWANFT.sol
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. Batch Minting Limit

Maximum 50 NFTs per batch to prevent gas limit issues:

```solidity
require(uris.length > 0 && uris.length <= 50, "Invalid batch size");
```

### 2. Platform Fee Cap

Platform fees capped at 10% to protect users:

```solidity
require(newFeeBasisPoints <= 1000, "Fee too high (max 10%)");
```

### 3. Auction Duration

Minimum 1 hour, maximum 30 days:

```solidity
require(duration >= 3600, "Minimum duration is 1 hour");
require(duration <= 30 days, "Maximum duration is 30 days");
```

## Threat Model

### Potential Threats

1. **Reentrancy Attacks**
   - ✅ Mitigated by `ReentrancyGuard`

2. **Front-Running**
   - ⚠️ Possible in auctions/purchases
   - Mitigation: Use private transactions or flashbots

3. **Access Control Bypass**
   - ✅ Mitigated by OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`

4. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**
   - ✅ Mitigated by Solidity 0.8.x built-in checks

5. **Denial of Service**
   - ✅ Batch size limits
   - ✅ Gas optimization

6. **Phishing/Social Engineering**
   - ⚠️ User education required
   - Use verified contract addresses

## Best Practices for Users

### For NFT Owners

1. **Verify Contract Addresses**
   - Always check on Etherscan
   - Bookmark official links
   - Never interact with unverified contracts

2. **Approve Carefully**
   ```javascript
   // ✅ Good - Approve specific token
   await nft.approve(marketplaceAddress, tokenId);
   
   // ❌ Bad - Blanket approval to unknown address
   await nft.setApprovalForAll(unknownAddress, true);
   ```

3. **Use Hardware Wallets**
   - For high-value NFTs
   - For admin/minter roles

### For Admins

1. **Multi-Signature Wallets**
   ```javascript
   // Use Gnosis Safe or similar
   // Require 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 for admin operations
   ```

2. **Time-Locks**
   - Add delay for critical operations
   - Gives users time to react

3. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for large transactions
   - Monitor role changes
   - Track unusual patterns

## Incident Response

### If Vulnerability Found

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Pause contracts immediately
   - Assess severity
   - Document the issue

2. **Communication**
   - Notify users via official channels
   - Be transparent about risks
   - Provide timeline for fix

3. **Fix and Deploy**
   - Fix vulnerability
   - Audit fix
   - Deploy and test
   - Unpause contracts

### Reporting Security Issues

**🔒 Responsible Disclosure**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. **Contact**: [@topsecretagent_007](https://t.me/topsecretagent_007)
3. **Include**:
   - Description of vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

**Bug Bounty**: We may offer rewards for valid security findings.

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security audit completed

- [ ] Access control tested
- [ ] Reentrancy protection verified
- [ ] Emergency pause tested
- [ ] Gas optimization reviewed
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Contract verification on Etherscan

- Predictability
- Trust
- Immutability

If upgradability is needed, consider:
- Transparent proxy pattern
- UUPS proxy pattern
- Diamond standard

## Emergency Procedures

   ```javascript
   await rwaNFT.pause();
   await marketplace.pause();
   ```

2. **Assess Damage**

   - Document everything

3. **Communicate**
   - Official announcement
   - Social media updates
   - Direct user contact if needed

4. **Remediation**
   - Deploy fixes
   - Consider compensation
   - Post-mortem report
